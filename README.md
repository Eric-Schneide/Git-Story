# Git-Story

Prompt:
From birth, your parents have done everything they could to stop you from going out during a full moon. 
At the age of 16, curiosity overwhelms you and you sneak out of the house during a full moon. You take a peek at the moon, and suddenly you turn into a log cabin. You are a werehouse.


Story:
I've never been fond of defiance, but I do understand why many children grow up to hate their parents. Since birth they've harbored me and kept their secrets. They think I don't know. They still think I haven't figured it out yet. The way they frantically close every curtain when there's a full moon out, or sometimes forcing me into the basement for the night. I even found the wolfbane they hid in my room just for safety. The writing's been on the walls since the day I was born. I am a werewolf. I just don't understand why they would want to hide this from me. It's a way of life and I deserve to be who I really am. It's not like I'm going to get hurt or anything either. I've seen Twilight and the only person who lost anything was me with ten hours of my life. My parents might want to hide me from the world, but one way or another it's going to find out, so it might as well be tonight. It's time for this wolf to howl.
